# Bondora Company Data Analysis Project

This repository contains the data analysis project for Bondora, focusing on various loan performance metrics, risk analysis, and default rate assessment. The project includes data preprocessing, visualization, and Power BI dashboards for interactive data exploration.


## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze the loan data from Bondora, a peer-to-peer lending company. The objective is to assess loan performance, identify risk factors, and visualize important metrics such as approval rates, default risks, and more.

The analysis includes:
- Data Preprocessing
- Risk Analysis
- Loan Approval Analysis
- Loan Performance Assessment
- Interactive Dashboards using Power BI

## Data
- **Preprocessed Dataset**: The dataset `preprocessed_data.csv` is provided and contains cleaned and processed data from Bondora.
- Original data was cleaned, missing values handled, and unnecessary columns removed in the preprocessing phase.

## Notebooks and Reports
The following Jupyter Notebooks and reports are part of the project:

- `Attributes_Definitions.ipynb`: Definitions and descriptions of all relevant data attributes.
- `data_preprocessing.ipynb`: Code used for cleaning and preprocessing the raw data.
- **Reports**:
  - `Loan Approval Report.pdf`: A detailed analysis of loan approvals.
  - `Loan Default Risk Report.pdf`: Risk analysis focusing on loan defaults.
  - `Loan Performance and Risk Analysis Report.pdf`: Comprehensive performance and risk analysis report.
  - `P2P_Lending_Report.pdf`: A report on peer-to-peer lending performance.

## Power BI and Tableau Dashboards
Interactive dashboards are available for detailed visualization:
- **Loan Approval Dashboard**: Visualizes loan approval rates and trends (`Loan_Approval_Dashboard.pbit`).
- **Loan Default Risk Dashboard**: Provides insights into the risk of loan defaults (`Loan Default Risk Analysis.pbix`).
- **Loan Performance and Risk Analysis Dashboard**: Comprehensive performance and risk analysis dashboard (`Loan Performance and Risk Analysis Dashboard.pbix`).
- **Career development analysis Dashboard**

## Technologies Used
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For data preprocessing and analysis.
- **Python Libraries**: 
  - Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
  - NumPy: For numerical operations.
  - Matplotlib and Seaborn: For basic data visualization.
- **Power BI** & **Tableau**: For creating interactive dashboards and data visualization.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Bondora-Company-DA-Project.git
   cd Bondora-Company-DA-Project
   ```

2. Open and run the Jupyter notebooks:
   - Install dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
     ```
   - Run `data_preprocessing.ipynb` to see the data preprocessing steps.
   - Open `Attributes_Definitions.ipynb` for data definitions.

3. Use Power BI to open `.pbix` or `.pbit` files for interactive exploration.

   git add README.md
   git commit -m "Add README file"
